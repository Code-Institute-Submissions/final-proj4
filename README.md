# thenewsole

An e-commerce website selling limited edition shoes. The working title for a shop name is called 'thenewsole' which sounds modern and contemporary.

This project is inspired by my husband's enthusiasm for buy and sell unique, timeless branded shoes.
 


## UX
 

#### RESEARCH
I interviewed my husband to know more about the quality, price of limited edition shoes. I asked him what his process is like in buying 'potential' shoes. Here's a list of questions


**What are the qualities of a sellable shoes (By order of importance)**
1. By model and design (eg. Jordan 1) (#1 in search engine)
2. By collaboration between shoe brands and artists (eg. off-white(Virgil Abloh) with nike, kanye west with adidas) (#3 in search engine)
3. Limited edition (shoes are not common to sell / 'hard-to-find')
4. Check the stock take (if there is stock available, its not sellable. if it's sold out or hard to add in cart, there's potential for high-sell)
5. By common asian size > (#2 in search engine)
6. By reseller's budget 


**List of websites he checks every 3 times a week**
- https://www.copgarden.com/
- https://www.adidas.com.sg/yeezy
- https://www.nike.com/
- https://stockx.com/


**What is your process in buying the shoes when there's an upcoming new release**
1. Checks the website for availability of that specific model
2. Selects the shoe size
3. Adds to cart (if it fails to add to cart, repeat this process)
4. Submit payment 


**Where do you sell these shoes?**
1. Carousell
2. Facebook Marketplace


**For ideas in creating wireframe for the 'kicks&sole' website, I did a simple hands-on test using [stocksx.com](https://stockx.com/) as my main reference with my husband. These are the directions / questions I asked him.**

<dl>
  <dt>Imagine you are about to buy a potential shoes, which part of the page do you first check?</dt>
  <dd> > Answer: I go to the popular release and click on the brand name</dd>

  <dt>Now that we are in the popular page, what do you do next?</dt>
  <dd> > Answer: I browse the page for the model I'm looking for</dd>

  <dt>When you see the model image, what's your next step?</dt>
  <dd> > Answer: I check for availability. If it's not available, I browse the other models</dd>

  <dt>Is there a way that you can reserve that model?</dt>
  <dd> > Answer: No, because this website don't allow you to do it. </dd>

  <dt>When you see that another model is available, what do you do? </dt>
  <dd> > Answer: I add it to cart. But there's a case that it is difficult to add it in due to high-demand so I have to be patient.</dd>

  <dt>I noticed that this other model with the same brand is available and easy to add to cart. Why is that?</dt>
  <dd> > Answer: Oh because the size is a smaller size and not that common. So the value may not be as high as I want to sell.</dd>

  <dt>How often do you visit this page?</dt>
  <dd> > Answer: It depends. If there's no new release coming up, I will check it once a week but if there's is, its 3x a week. </dd>

  <dt>Where do you hear the news about these new release?</dt>
  <dd> > Answer: Through facebook page or youtube shoe enthusiast. </dd>

**User Profiles**

Majority of the users demographics are based on:
- Male, between 20 years old to 40 years old. 
- majority of users are college to working men 
- active in social media 

The target users of this website will be:
- shoe enthusiast
- shoe reseller 
- admin
 

1. **Specific buyer who buys for personal use or shoe reseller**
    - someone who is looking for specific model of a shoe brand
    - a registered user of the website who will be lead to 'login' page to access his profile
    - likes to check on reviews in 'review' section of the page

2. **Browser**
    - someone who is casually browsing through the 'landing page'
    - likes to research more about the shoe brand and price by checking out the 'landing page', 'most popular' and 'new release' products
    - a non-member or guest of the website

#### DESIGN

- I'm using **Abril Fatface** font by Google Fonts. I picked this for its contemporary style and bold type represents a strong emphasis on the webpage. This font is complemented by Open sans type which will be used for body text, prices, shoe models and reviews, 

- **Color** used will be black and white. I observed that most shoe websites have a plain background. This is to showcase the product details and design. 

- I'm taking a simple approach to this website to showcase more on the products.

- This will be mobile responsive which can be viewed in tablets and mobile phones as well.

## Technologies Used

In this section, these are the tools, languages, frameworks, and libraries I used for this project. 
- [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) 
    - This is used to create structure for web pages.
- [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) 
    - This is used to style the website by adding fonts, colors and design.
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - Used JQuery minified version for Cloudinary.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) 
    - This is used for web responsiveness and also used pre-built components.  
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) 
    - For designing wireframes 
- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) 
    - For uploading images to cloud for storage.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
